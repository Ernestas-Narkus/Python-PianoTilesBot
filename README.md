# Python PianoTilesBot

Created a Python Bot that can auto click the tiles in a Piano Tiles game.

This game specifically: https://www.games.co.uk/game/magic-piano-tiles#theatermode

Can select what key you use to start/stop it.

Variables to easily change the code to suit your setup. (You will need to mess about to find the pixels yourself)
